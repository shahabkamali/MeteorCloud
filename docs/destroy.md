# Destroy an installation

Removes AWS resources and local installer state for all enabled services.

## Commands

```bash
edge-installer destroy installation.yaml          # prompts for confirmation
edge-installer destroy installation.yaml --yes

make down                                         # same as destroy --yes
```

## What happens

1. Ansible `destroy.yml` (when SSH works):
   - Stops WireGuard if `vpn` was enabled
   - Stops Docker Compose stack if `cloud_app` was enabled
2. `terraform destroy` — EC2, SG, EIP, VPN rules
3. Deletes `.installer-state/<name>/installation.json`

## Warnings

- **All data on the EC2 instance is lost** (PostgreSQL, Redis, VPN config)
- Elastic IP is released
- Cannot be undone

Confirm installation name and region before proceeding.

## Partial failure

If destroy fails:

1. Check SSH access to the instance
2. Inspect `.installer-state/<name>/terraform/terraform.tfstate`
3. Review resources in AWS console
4. Retry `edge-installer destroy installation.yaml --yes`
